# Nature VR  

Making the natural treasures of our world accessible to everyone. The project will take 2d images of natural scenes, and attempt to texture 3d Unity environments, using a complex of machine learning approaches for interpolating texture and depth from static images.

## Todo

* [x] Conduct a test of texture application in Unity: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyHGAwoJIWQ  
* [ ] Add the Unity project as a subtree  
* [ ] Designate an appropiate repository for large binary files.  
* [ ] Decide on 360 video recommendations:  
  - https://vuze.camera/  
  - http://www.lg.com/us/mobile-accessories/lg-LGR105.AVRZTS-360-cam  
* [x] Decide on how to license work  
  - GPL? http://law.stackexchange.com/questions/6455/use-an-image-under-gnu-gpl-in-a-commercial-application  
* [ ] How to build on existing work?
